Input: File starts with one integer n, followed by n integer values.

Example: 4 9 11 4 5 â†’ n = 4, data = 9 11 4 5

So the array would be: data[0] = 9, data[1] = 11, etc.

Binary Tree:

Insert all elements from the array into a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Inorder Traversal:

Traverse the tree inorder (Left, Root, Right) and print values.

Output:

Display the sorted list from the BST.
