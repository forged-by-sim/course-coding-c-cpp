int quiz

1. See the code below:

#include <stdio.h>   
int main(void) {
    int  miles = 26, yards = 385;
    int kilometers;
    kilometers = 1.609 * (miles + yards/1760.0);
    printf("\nA marathon is %d kilometers.\n", kilometers);
    return 0;
 }  


What does this program print, because of int kilometers? 

==> A marathon is 42 kilometers.  


2. See the code below: 

#include <stdio.h>  
 int main(void) {
    int  miles = 26, yards = 385;
    int kilometers;
    kilometers = 1.609 * (miles + yards/1760.0);
    printf("\nA marathon is %d kilometers.\n", kilometers);
    return 0;
 }  


Why do we use the format specifier %d instead of %lf?  

==> lf (as in %lf, not "if") is a double and the int answer would print incorrectly.
