1. Assume i = 1; j = 2;  

n = (i < j);


==> n is 1



2. Assume i = 1; j = 2;  

n = (i == j)? 4:(i < j)?3:5;


==> n is 3



3. Assume i = 1; j = 2;  

n = (i, j);  


==> n is 2



4. Assume i = 1; j = 2;  

n = i, j+1;  


==> n is 1



5. Assume i = 1; j = 2;  

n = (i < j)? 4: 6; 


==> n is 4
