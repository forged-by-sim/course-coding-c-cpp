While loop questions


1.

while (i < 5){
    i = i – 1;
    printf(" i = %d", i);
}


If i starts off as 2 (assume int i = 2 declared at the beginning of the code) then...

==> printf will print continuously



2.

while (i < 5){
    i = i – 1;
    printf(" i = %d", i);
}


If i starts off as 2 (assume int i = 2 declared at the beginning of the code) and the loop statement was i = i +1; printf will print ...

==> i = 3 i = 4 i = 5



3.

while (i < 5){
    i = i – 1;
    printf(" i = %d", i);
}


If i starts off as 15 (assume int i = 15 declared at the beginning of the code), printf will print ...

==> will not print
